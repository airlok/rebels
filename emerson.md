None but he knows what that is which he can do, nor does he know until he has tried.

Trust thyself: every heart vibrates to that iron string.

Whoso would be a man must be a nonconformist. He who would gather immortal palms must
not be hindered by the name of goodness, but must explore if it be goodness. Nothing
is at last sacred but the integrity of your own mind. Absolve you to yourself, and you
shall have the suffrage of the world.

Truth is handsomer than the affectation of love. Your goodness must have some edge to
it, â€” else it is none.

It is easy in the world to live after the world's opinion; it is easy in solitude to
live after our own; but the great man is he who in the midst of the crowd keeps with
perfect sweetness the independence of solitude.

A foolish consistency is the hobgoblin of little minds, adored by little statesmen
and philosophers and divines. With consistency a great soul has simply nothing to do.

Is it so bad, then, to be misunderstood? Pythagoras was misunderstood, and Socrates,
and Jesus, and Luther, and Copernicus, and Galileo, and Newton, and every pure and
wise spirit that ever took flesh. To be great is to be misunderstood. 

All history resolves itself very easily into the biography of a few stout and earnest
persons.

When we discern justice, when we discern truth, we do nothing of ourselves, but allow
a passage to its beams.

Man is timid and apologetic; he is no longer upright; he dares not say 'I think,' 'I
am,' but quotes some saint or sage. He is ashamed before the blade of grass or the
blowing rose. These roses under my window make no reference to former roses or to better
ones; they are for what they are; they exist with God to-day. There is no time to them.
There is simply the rose; it is perfect in every moment of its existence. Before a leaf-
bud has burst, its whole life acts; in the full-blown flower there is no more; in the
leafless root there is no less. Its nature is satisfied, and it satisfies nature, in
all moments alike. But man postpones or remembers; he does not live in the present, but
with reverted eye laments the past, or, heedless of the riches that surround him, stands
on tiptoe to foresee the future. He cannot be happy and strong until he too lives with
nature in the present, above time.

If we live truly, we shall see truly. It is as easy for the strong man to be strong, as
it is for the weak to be weak.

But now we are a mob. Man does not stand in awe of man, nor is his genius admonished to
stay at home, to put itself in communication with the internal ocean, but it goes abroad
to beg a cup of water of the urns of other men. We must go alone.

And truly it demands something godlike in him who has cast off the common motives of
humanity, and has ventured to trust himself for a taskmaster. High be his heart, faithful
his will, clear his sight, that he may in good earnest be doctrine, society, law, to
himself, that a simple purpose may be to him as strong as iron necessity is to others! 

Prayer is the contemplation of the facts of life from the highest point of view. It is
the soliloquy of a beholding and jubilant soul. It is the spirit of God pronouncing his
works good.

Travelling is a fool's paradise. Our first journeys discover to us the indifference of
places.
